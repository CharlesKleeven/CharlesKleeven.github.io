<h1>General Concepts and Ideas || Brainstorming</h1>

<h2>General</h2>
<h3>General Ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li>Concerns:</li>

</ul>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>sprite:screen ratio</p>
</li>
<li><p>different areas as separate screens vs one large screen</p>
</li>
<li><p>different cultures/diversity</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>how to/if i should include different cultures like asian kids.</li>

</ul>
<p>thought: exterior of buildings can be rather generic, but interior is how cultures shine; there can be signs on the exterior to indicate personalities of the characters also</p>
<ul>
<li>don’t create token characters and don’t make it feel like you’re trying to reach a quota or something. however, i do want to include minorities.</li>
<li>how to go about character’s diversity in terms of generic features and cohesiveness of each character. want to split into different communities or economic statuses</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>how to get players to use their name without feeling left out/taken out of immersion?</p>
<blockquote><p>one option: create a boy character option, and if both are in-game, one can be blind or something and player can choose to take care of their sibling</p>
<p>issue: might be too dark or condescending towards the blind though. also, how will that affect amount of work needed to be done?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>setting of the lush area</p>
<blockquote><p>initially, i wanted area to feel undiscovered. like nobody had even laid their eyes on it before, not to mention buildings and the like, even considering devoid of animal life in some areas, too. however, i like the idea of lore and artifacts that can reveal things, like history, origin of the world. cool things i’d be able to implement are things like statues (that could include puzzles or goals/objects that need to be met) or shrines. many possibilities. but the original love and whole reason for creating the lush area was to escape life, into the “wilderness.” hm…</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>seasons change and people potentially die, but the children don’t grow older? should there be a time skip for certain characters to die?</p>
</li>
<li><p>should characters have parents? if so, how relevant are they to gameplay?</p>
</li>
<li><p>how to go about the secret tree house club</p>
</li>
<li><p>are the children street urchins? that was the original idea, but i also want to give them families and backgrounds. if so, how should i still incorporate the street urchin group for mob leader?</p>
</li>
<li><p>portrait animation? if so, how to implement?</p>
</li>
<li><p>UI?: inventory, health stats, time displays, dialogue boxes, head image vs body image, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>screen resolution size? people say 640x360 is best game resolution, but then cyangmou says 480x272 for 48px sprites is most common and most effective.</p>
</li>
<li><p>screen perspective for more immersive experience?: when the player explores, i want a close up view, but i also want players to feel small at times. difficult because the resolution stays the same. </p>
</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Original ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play as an orphan/child of deadbeat parents/hardworking parents who are poor af. Run to the woods to raise food and sell.</li>
<li>Get tasks and quests from a group of kids who know the ins and outs of cities.</li>
<li>In a setting similar to eastward and escape into a beautiful lush place.</li>

</ul>
<p>Update:</p>
<ul>
<li>portraits and bodies</li>
<li>maybe make this game about rebuilding the torn down world</li>
<li>lots of ambient noises, satisfying sounds too — (like when stepping on stones to cross water)</li>
<li>goal atmosphere in lush world: serene, alone, quiet, solemn/melancholy (maybe farm area would just be peaceful without the melancholy?? Maybe), should feel small—in a large open world.</li>
<li>possibility: slow down time while fishing maybe? (Idk, may be a bad idea), and also low-key recover health?</li>
<li>let’s make this game about my childhood fantasies and dreams. anohana as inspo</li>
<li>harvest moon inspo: leia. maybe a secret, dark area where the character meets a child creature. the child creature doesn’t know anything about how they shouldn’t meet humans. they can only meet at certain times.</li>
<li>bapbap’s (corn creatures) and jomjom’s, moo moo</li>
<li>look to the stories i wrote as a kid for some ideas for characters and stuff</li>
<li>secret handshake/password/pass to get into base</li>
<li>skateboard for moving faster? maybe piggy back ride on robo friend</li>
<li>objectives (e.g. bundles in Stardew Valley)</li>
<li>for lore, artifacts and characters mentioning things very naturally that allude to the backstory of the world</li>
<li>characters should not be OP and be able to just be able to do or solve anything</li>
<li>rpging, like we were secret spies or special agents, superheros. </li>
<li>seasonal activities, like building snowmen</li>
<li>when in lush area, npc’s offering shelter or something? google classic npc game</li>
<li>shit bro. i just realized i could read my old posts and take out some of what i said as dialogue. stuff like “I’d rather lay on the ground outside and just decay. Decompose onto the earth.” and omg i don’t even remember writing this: “…things pass. I don’t know if there’s necessarily a light at the end of the tunnel; it feels like the demon is still waiting for me, but I do know that even if there is no light at the end, I can adjust to the darkness.”</li>
<li>end credits! maybe end credits with references to the games, and everyone grown up?! like maybe the secret tree house abandoned or idk, reveal things. like how huge statues were small. references could be like a reference to some event. example: someone drops something on the group, and end credits could be that object much older and overgrown idk. basically, there’s a lot of potentials in end credits. like credits with flashes of the future</li>
<li>thoughts when clicking on objects could be like inner voice of mc (however this makes it seem less like player controlled so hmmm..)</li>
<li>okay, in scene i’ve always imagined: you can have a house and to relax, you can climb onto roof and stare at sky or something, maybe look below to see scenery like running rivers or something</li>
<li>koi fish: patterns and names. could be cool for character creation or something who knows.</li>
<li>so what about a different change in perspective when being inside a room vs outside a room. for example, when being inside a room, the view is closer, and you have to run around the room with a small camera view. you don’t see everything right away, makes for a more intimate surrounding… how would that even work though? the character doesn’t have high enough resolution… :/</li>
<li>yo, maybe the mc’s puffy shorts could play a big deal in the game like inventory and whatnot?? check out entry 23 in the notebook/journal</li>
<li>general idea: maybe a character could introduce themselves as a name, but only friends refer to them as a nickname. name tag goes from name to nickname? and there can be a scene where you can ask if you can call them by their nickname. if so, their name tag changes to nickname.</li>
<li>title screen: a huge opportunity to have a meaningful scene, perhaps something that players may look at at first and not really notice too much, but after playing the game, it hits them in the feels. (inspo: last of us 2). another cool thing could be after “finishing” a game, the title screen could change ever so slightly (inspo: liar princess and blind prince). also, moonlighter is a great menu screen too, how interactive it is.</li>
<li>crows during the winter/fall! maybe have something with their intelligence, feeding them nuts</li>
<li>bro wtf: i just had this idea: so imagine this: gardening and cooking. you go and cook the food, and not just input ingredients. like cooking mama, kinda. ??? and then you can pay to open a shop and sell from there?? bruh? </li>
<li>regardless of above idea, i think it’s a good idea to have rundown places and be able to pay a large fee to rebuild/buy parts of the town</li>
<li>the mermaid can teach the player how to swim, which will allow access to other areas.</li>
<li>while i was reading environmental storytelling, this is a thought i had for the initial gameplay: cutscene where player hears parents talking about cost of living is too high, it’s too hard to even get food on the plate these days. the move to the town area that’s pretty poor. the player is led to believe they need to find things to sell somehow. you rummage through garbage and try to pick things up, and sell but they’re practically worthless. that’s the initial gameplay until you find the lush area and the player comes up with the idea to plant and sell stuff?</li>
<li>the whole parents part can definitely be changed. they can be really hardworking and realize that they can’t support their kid and believe that their kid can be sent to relatives who are in a better place. maybe the parents send money every month but you hear your relatives laugh and decide to not use the money on you. they talk about teaching you the way the world works and having to find money for yourself. trying to find food or something to just survive. maybe instead of finding anything to sell, you can just be looking for food. hunger bar can be super low!! if you can’t find any food, some character can find you and share some of their food with you and that can be the opening!</li>
<li>lamp poles. maybe if you run and interact with a pole on an intersection, you can swing and get a short speed boost?</li>
<li>better garden organization? : for example, you could make a box to grow an herb garden or whatever you choose. build different pots and containers as an option outside of just growing to mass produce on a farm</li>
<li>idea: graffiti wall is something player can draw?</li>
<li>setting idea: okay, so i was thinking about 1890s with their clothing and lifestyle, but honestly this doesn’t coincide with things like a camera or sentient ai. i’ve been thinking that maybe this is taking place in the far future where people are afraid of technology and people are not allowed to use anything technically advanced. you can tell some of the lore by what is discovered in magnetic fishing. how about the sentient ai we find is actually very similar-looking to humans, but has chipped paint or is broken just enough to know that its a robot. then there could be a plot twist, where a character who is adopted is actually a robot, but this is never explicitly confirmed. or if it is, there can be a tragic event where the child is taken away to be incinerated or destroyed as the parents watch in agony and try to fight back even. this emotion invoked should be a feeling of anger, pity, helplessness, and empathy because we have been taking care of our own little ai friends. ?? idea?</li>
<li>environmental storytelling: can say a lot about the prices of items and what items are fished from magnetic fishing</li>
<li>omg plot twist: today’s july 24, 2020, over a year since i came up with the idea for this game. i just had a thought while sketching out a possible sentient ai friend: what if the bandaid on the character signified that low-key the mc is actually a robot herself?? bruh? and the bandaid basically is just hiding some missing paint or something; oof but then what’s the point of having the sentient ai around. the mc can’t be strong despite being a robot. ugh.</li>
<li>instead of fishing not passing time, how about just little spots around the map where time doesn&#39;t pass so you can just sit and absorb the music, sounds, or just relax a bit without worry about time</li>
<li>different resolution sizes for different areas of game?</li>
<li>Holidays can low-key be breaks for the player (i.e. AI friend can take over the farm for you lol)</li>
<li>walking near characters forms little conversation bubbles above them as they talk to each other. walking away makes the conversation bubbles disappear</li>
<li>I want this game to pass the Bechdel test for sure. (must have 2 named women, they must have a conversation, that conversation isn&#39;t about a man)</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What I enjoy in games</h3>
<ul>
<li>music connects to the soul. distinct to certain times/areas</li>

</ul>
<blockquote><p>examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>different times of animal crossing music</li>
<li>seasonal music of HMDS</li>
<li>locations of Radiant Historia</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>relationship building! differences in expression and dialogue</p>
</li>
<li><p>Easter eggs!</p>
</li>
<li><p>people are individuals with personality, back story, etc.  not cookie-cutters, and range in age and attitude</p>
</li>
<li><p>difficulty of 100% completion, but freedom to do whatever</p>
</li>
<li><p>partial to earth tones rather than bright or pastel-y (e.g. look at rune factory series)</p>
</li>
<li><p>an official website (almost like guide)</p>
</li>
<li><p>enjoyable sound effects (e.g. using weapons, picking up items and storing, opening chests, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>littering had repercussions</p>
</li>
<li><p>dancing when idle</p>
</li>
<li><p>chests with cool stuff</p>
</li>
<li><p>pets! even plant pets too</p>
</li>
<li><p>nice talking sounds </p>
<blockquote><p>examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>animalese (Animal Craft)</li>
<li>little dot-like noises</li>
<li>even in Pewdiepie’s Minecraft council of beet sound-effects (<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D2vWXt1uII&amp;list=PLYH8WvNV1YEnLCzUDWueIZQXDNhqLKywk&amp;index=4&amp;t=456s'>source</a>)</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>typography is really important: adds a lot of life to characters</p>
</li>
<li><p>animal crossing interaction with villagers. villagers have different requests: some play hide-and-seek, some ask for items</p>
</li>
<li><p>no main goal: make your own goals!</p>
</li>
<li><p>HMDS Cute pet interaction (with villagers too)</p>
</li>
<li><p>key change in octopath traveller music</p>
</li>
<li><p>using music to tell stories (look at Hollow Knight); e.g. related characters have related melodies</p>
</li>
<li><p>when going from one area to the next, being able to hear both area’s music when in the middle (i.e. music fades(?) instead of abruptly changing)</p>
</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ideas/Feels (from Journal)</h3>
<ul>
<li>really want each character to feel like they’re living their own separate lives in different areas</li>
<li>want a sense of discovery (“like peaking behind curtains”) for each character</li>
<li>have winding roads, lots of rooms and doors that might not ever open, back alleys, or something</li>
<li>while brainstorming overarching theme: sad and a bit lonely, but uplifting. at the end of the day, things will be okay. a bit heavy-hearted. reliving cherished memories. sense of yearning, world is too big to ever know. peace and serenity. longing of happy memories of the past. mainly longing of happy memories of the past.</li>
<li>other feelings while brainstorming: fighting and making up, childhood imagination, heart-achy, yearning, children’s traits (e.g. wonders of children, racing imagination, unending honesty, love for all regardless of race, gender, or status). at the end of the day, our differences are trivial we are all human.</li>
<li>town theme: differences in wealth and ethnicity, different communities (e.g. some are more hard-working and gritty, others less-so, one may be naively optimistic), devoid of plants (living), for the most part. mostly dirt and stone, maybe old wood. perhaps the town can start as super cold, quite lonely, but the mc can bring people together. the secret base can be gentle, happy music. preferably: solemn music for the town.</li>
<li>lush area theme: serene, alone, quiet melancholy, sublime. also want an area that is sad, and a bit spooky. should feel small, in a large world. feel mystical, dream-like; like thinking back to childhood memories, discovery, adventure. journey. people should wish they were born in that world. LARGE landscapes= large branches, leaves, water tea, hidden market</li>
<li>children should practically have utter freedom, but should also have backgrounds</li>
<li>animals and such should not look “cute” like kawaii cute.</li>
<li>incorpate the strong bond that i felt with others, where it felt like us against the world, and we only have each other to lean on. that feeling of “bonding through shared trauma and anxiety.” this makes me rethink how I should go about the secret tree house club. a lot of good manga typically bond over shared problems. i think it should be important to at least have some shared secret information between the kids or perhaps the player will be able to know why certain things happen while other villagers just shit on and jump to conclusions with the children</li>
<li>implementation ideas: running over large leaves as the leaves slightly bounce/wobble as you walk across. </li>
<li>want to split characters into different communities or economic statuses, and what about generic features of characters and the cohesiveness of each character. </li>
<li>want less conventionally attractive characters but still with character appeal.</li>
<li>sharing intimate moments during childhood/youth can really have a lasting impression. make sure the night music is really peaceful and allows for opportunities to bond.</li>
<li>perhaps for mermaid, we can only meet at certain times and one day they disappear or something, or maybe have a character(s) who mainly bonds and opens up at night. idk how i would go about this but still. i’d love to capture this feeling, this connection with someone one day. feels kinda similar to hanging out with Nina in the good ol’ days watching the stars and playing at night. perhaps even just sitting together, bored as hell. even if it was boring in the moment, it’s left wonderful memories for a lifetime.</li>
<li>sprites: worried about how I should go about creating them. they’d probably be &lt;= 48px, and i want them to have eyes and mouths without looking freaky, unreadable, or too chili. eastward has so much. character not only in their designs but also their movements, like the blinking.</li>
<li>how to keep lush area unexplored by humans but still have places and things to discover— spirit buddies. maybe even secret civilizations or something. they could be the ones to create cool places. maybe even nature itself would create them. like, imagine huge tree roots winding up and down and even all around, acting as staircases or something. or even trees/other plant-life creating things that resemble shrines. i wonder if this still takes away the feeling of serenity and alone-ness feeling that I’m trying to achieve.</li>
<li>perhaps using the moving between scenes rapidly thing could be used to our advantage, like we could change “view”/“perspective” when walking up to statues, buildings, etc. for a better look. for example, when discovering a spooky house, it could be regular top down when approaching, then switch to side view when hight next to it for the first time or something</li>
<li>focus on speech mannerisms for characters, be able to heard each character’s distinct voice clearly in head</li>
<li>oneiric is a word meaning “relating to dreams” with different word origins and roots.</li>
<li>perhaps allude koi names somewhere, such as having a character be named similar to a koi pattern and having their appearance kinda show that pattern somewhere, or a character could even be really interested in koi fish</li>
<li>wonderful moments in adventure time: adventure time moves forward with the overall story and characters. i want to capture that raw emotions of friendship, melancholy, the feeling of reminiscence, and just happy-sad vibes.</li>
<li>should puffy shorts be the main component of the character? what if shorts was the inventory instead of the rucksack? character could look like they’re putting item into their shorts, and perhaps inventory ui could be hand reaching into pocket and that could be inventory screen. also expansion of inventory could be getting more pockets or something. inspired by moonlighter: an idea for the inventory screen could be the player character rummaging through their pockets and when flipping through inventory screens, the player could be “searching/rummaging” through different pockets, so each page could represent a specific pocket they’re searching through. you could even animate very subtle rummaging through the pockets. also, when characters fall from high spots, the shorts could puff up and essentially parachute them down softly. this could enable fast travel or shortcuts too. also, this is probably too cute, but you could also animate a cute scene where the player sleeps engulfed in her shorts, like they’re blankets.</li>
<li>really love the strong narrative in A Dark Room where nothing is spelled out, and makes you question things. also the events are really nice, like the one with the thief— you can hang him to show as an example or you can let him go. i chose to let them go, and in turn i was taught stealth. also the event where you can choose to trust random wanderers or not is pretty interesting. really enjoyed the atmosphere created by the repetitive motion of tending to the fire. the storytelling was really nice because of so many implications and puzzle pieces and it’s really up to the player to put these puzzles together and theorize</li>
<li>look at environmental story telling. i could use this as setting/lore of game</li>
<li>so you know how i wanted to find the robot ai in the ground, rusted up, and a young child in the woods? what if they were one and the same. that could add to it— sentient AI. a thought: maybe you have to raise the robot to be stronger and making them stronger unlocks certain areas because they can help you somehow.</li>
<li>banana bike to peel out? heehee pun</li>

<h3>Short Lines/Quotes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes I burn out, and it scares me. Who am I without a love for learning? Am I anything? It’s like waking up from a fog and realizing that everything is pointless. I’m not scared of things being pointless. I’m scared of feeling like everything is.</li>
<li>I actually don&#39;t like this hairstyle.</li>
<li>“Will we meet again?” “Sure we will.” “Promise?” “Promise… Now go, and don’t look back…” - Spirited Away</li>
<li>&quot;I know it&#39;s my fault they don&#39;t like me, but I try so hard to be good and I just can&#39;t. I&#39;m so mean and angry all the time and I don&#39;t know why. I just want my dad to come take me away.&quot; Her dad died in a car accident two years earlier. - reddit post</li>
<li>&quot;Smoking a cigarette, listening to this, watching the stars on my roof. This is when I feel safe. When it feels like time stopped. There Is nothing around me and waits for me.. Just the moment and me. As if we are on a date. The universe and I.” - youtube comment</li>
<li>“I want to be a painter. Everywhere I go, I want to paint smiles on people’s faces.” - not sure where/who this came from</li>
<li>Thanks for sharing this with me. It&#39;s not hypocritical at all that your status is like that. Often time, the advice we give to others is the advice we need to hear ourselves the most. I&#39;m here if you ever need to rant about your anxiety and other things.</li>
<li>Does space taste silky and cold or warm and creamy?</li>
<li>You know, when you&#39;re surrounded by nothing but shitty people, sometimes you get really attached to the slightly less shitty ones.</li>

</li>
<li><p>abandoned areas?</p>
</li>
<li><p>hole through walls where character can take as shortcut</p>
</li>
<li><p>a room that the player never opens, but can hear music from every now and then. it’s like getting to know a person without ever seeing them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>for graffiti wall idea: maybe player can draw on it or be able to choose from a few styles (feature)</p>
</li>
<li><p>level design idea:  have certain areas be used mainly by the children while other areas not so much. can tell a lot about those who use the area.</p>
</li>
<li><p>some buildings can mysteriously have an entrace/exit that are far from each other</p>
</li>
<li><p>room decoration idea: balancing bear</p>
<p> </p>
</li>

</ul>
<h3>Lush Areas</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Big leaves! Big leaves, big trees, heckin heck, maybe walking across leaves? On huge branches, too. Also, swimming up into water area.</p>
</li>
<li><p>town of different species in forest</p>
</li>
<li><p>lush area / farm : waterfall and river (should have hidden area behind waterfall—idk what for yet, maybe a home or storage area or something)</p>
</li>
<li><p>a clearing or something. usually it’s darkness and trees, but given a special time, there can be light emanating between the trunks of the trees. when you go and investigate, it’s a whole bright, lively city/village/market or something. if you leave and return on not the special time, it’s like nothing was there, almost like it was an illusion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>i really like my drawing of sitting under a mushroom., maybe you can collect water drops from the mushrooms</p>
</li>
<li><p>Here are some bodies of water that are cool:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>lagoon</li>
<li>spring</li>
<li>swamp</li>
<li>wadi (good for arid places) = dry except for rainy season</li>
<li>arroyo (good for arid or semi-arid places) = dry except for heavy rains and rainy season</li>
<li>fjord (between cliffs!)</li>
<li>tarn (surrounded by mountains)</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>metallic-looking flowers instead of shiny chests with flower opening noise instead of chest open noises</p>
</li>
<li><p>an idea would be 4 areas, each representing fire/water/earth/wind and coincide with summer/winter/spring/fall and:</p>
</li>
<li><p>instead of having straight fire/water/earth/wind elements, we can use a mix of real/fantasy aspects within the environment. for example: for the fire area, instead of sand + fire-y aspects, we could do a forest with fire-esque trees (this was inspired by forest in God of War)</p>
</li>

</ul>
<h3>Other General Map Ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>maybe lush place is warm toned while city is cool toned</p>
</li>
<li><p>Internal monologue about what kind of player experience I want the map to add:</p>
<blockquote><p>okay listen up, i had a euphoric moment at night and ranted for a couple hours or something about this: i know how to do the map now, or at least have a better idea: basically, think back to harvest moon ds cute. there were different areas of the “town” that made it seem less like a town, and more like a whole life. while playing hmds, you really get to choose which area of the town you spend your time in. because i was wooing skye, i spent a lot of time in the mines area and outskirts of town and maybe near the manor or so. if i chose gustav, that’d be different. or when i wooed leia, i spent a lot of time in daryl’s lab. the whole charm of hmds was that around the “town,” there were different areas where certain characters spent much of their time and depending on how you decide to play, you get to choose where you spend your time, whether you choose consciously or subconciously. for the game, my idea is to try to capture this charm by creating different areas and having characters spend most of their time in their “home” base or whatever you want to call it. a second idea is perhaps when you befriend them, you can invite them to festivals, parties, or recruit them into some club or something, maybe secret tree house club or something lmao (idea not formed yet). in regards to charm of hmds, bad examples of what not to do is create town as one single area where all characters are all the time aside from their home. characters should have their own routine, which includes being in their actual home areas, and spending leisure time and/or work or whatever else in certain areas, whether they enjoy spending time searching in trash or running around in the dead tree forest or whatever. make everything seem alive. they should also do things at different times of day—some night owls, some morning birds, etc. there can be a commons place though (where people often meet/pass by).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Internal monologue about style and overall mood/theme of town: (tl;dr at end)</p>
<blockquote><p>i just had a full speech in my head about the town i want to create: basically talking about how i could have easily just created a cute, quaint town with happy people, but wanted to create a town that meant a lot to me and came from my soul. for me, it’s like the difference between, say an isekai and a mundane slice of life manga. i used to think wild, fantastical worlds were amazing, and while I still enjoy such worlds, as I’ve grown over the years, my tastes have changed. I’ve learned I really enjoy super-ordinary slice-of-life manga. Although I really do enjoy the more dramatic slice-of-lifes, like the ones where one of the two main characters has a terminal disease or memory problems or something and the other main character doesn’t know, I’ve learned that my favorite are actually just the slice of life where nothing extreme happens. when i watch good mundane slice of life it’s like i’m able to notice and capture small, valuable moments and i’ve grown to love that. like how studio ghibli characters feel so human and the movies, such as my neighbor totoro, feel like i’m peering into someone’s life that’s sprinkled with fantasy. i do enjoy super cute, happy towns, but i guess i have an affinity towards towns like hmds because they’re just so normal. i’ve really learned to like the small things— i remember how i used to really dislike the workout dad who i thought was weird, while i really liked his beautiful wife and their cool kid. i also felt bad for that one tired dad and was annoyed by his little, obnoxious daughter who was always laughing. it was just the little things that made it feel so much more real. another big thing is that, and i can only speak for myself, when i play or read about a cute world where everyone is happy and gets along when i’m, y’know, a bit sad, i start thinking things like “i wish i lived in this world” but then it sometimes spirals into “why can’t the world be like this?” or “why couldn’t i have been born here” to even feeling like everyone is mocking me and my situation/feelings with their happiness. that’s not to say that i can’t play or read about perfect, little towns when I’m down, but sometimes it just doesn’t feel like it’s on the same emotional level to reach me. while with a mundane world, it may start off as dull, but if you look closely, the less obvious things start to really shine once you pay attention. i guess the main difference for me, is that with a cute, happy little town i feel a strong sense of yearning and want, while with a mundane, slice-of-life town i’ve learned to appreciate, and although this difference is small, it’s a difference i still greatly value nonetheless.  </p>
<p>tl;dr: make a mundane, slice-of-life-esque town instead of a fantastical, happy, perfect little town.</p>

<li><p>everything should have a story behind it, like idk. when looking at art, people like stories (think of empty crown - yas)</p>

<li><p>environmental storytelling:</p>
<blockquote><ol start='' >
<li><p>In the beginning, games often use tutorials, cutscenes, demos (showing how to play), expositions (description/explanations) to get gameplay across. However, these are often used too frequently and act as a crutch. The less of a barrier between narrative and player, the more drawn the player is into the story. with a compelling design, interesting objects, and good storytelling, players should be able to PLAY and not just watch. Try just dropping the character into the world and allowing them to play.</p>
<p>key: <mark>SHOW DON’T TELL</mark> (e.g. look at papers please) and <mark>DON’T INTERRUPT GAMEPLAY</mark>. you can have things like diaries, journals, objects that hold significance, but they should all be incorporated into the environmental storytelling.</p>
<p><a href='https://super.magfest.org/mages-blog/the-compelling-art-of-environmental-storytelling-story-through-play'>source</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><mark>EVERY DETAIL PLACED IN THE WORLD MUST MAKE SENSE</mark>. For example: edges of the world. Players can’t run around forever, so there must be something blocking their movement. Some people put invisible walls or arbitrary objects, and it can definitely break immersion with thinking like “Why can’t we just jump over this fence?” and same with shrubbery. An immersive game will make sense within the world such as the world being surrounded by water and the player can only swim for so long before drowning or there are really high cliffs/mountains that can’t be climbed. </p>
<p>(Idea: there is an unlockable area that is surrounded by water? Player can only access after learning how to swim from mermaid?)</p>
<ul>
<li>Staging scenes: being able to create stories from static scenes when examined closely. this can be done through the setting of the scene (e.g. abandoned mental asylum vs mysterious mansion), placement of props (“Why is there a toilet plunger on the roof?”), and arrangement of people/creatures around the scene.</li>
<li>optional reading: some players like to read and get more from the world while others just want to play. this can be done via optional readings. some ways are books, journals, diaries, scrolls, emails, etc.</li>
<li>items and architecture: for example, craftsmanship says a lot about who forged it, architecture of a town can say a lot about the history of the town and the inhabitants like their lifestyle and economic status. some games, like dark souls, tell almost all their lore through descriptions of items that certain characters have.</li>
<li>other techniques: clothing and appearance of characters, background dialogue!! (what I plan to do), character routines and actions (also what i plan to do!!): may also reveal some secrets, real-world connections (bruh, this is hella advanced: make numbers that are referenced in the game or make websites similar to what the characters visit) </li>

<li><ol start='' >
<li><p>not too messy/chaotic, not too ordered. we want variety and order, organized complexity. </p>
</li>
<li><p>lively is more likable than dead. it’s better to be able to see people as they’re working or walking around rather than hidden behind walls and buildings. full of people working through windows</p>
</li>
<li><p>compact: only the poor lived huddled together, and people eventually moved to live spaced far apart, but this actually just creates a dead feeling. </p>
</li>
<li><p>orientation and mystery: a lot of little back streets and small lanes where you can feel cozy and get a bit lost: drawn to sense of mystery and enclosure provided by these. certain areas have balconies that almost touch each other. makes people nicer and whatnot. but you still need some privacy. hence, the ideal:</p>
<p><mark>big boulevards; grand wide straight places, and also little warrens of streets; gives off mystery and orientation</mark></p>
</li>
<li><p>scale (&lt;5 stories): there can be larger buildings, but it should be kept for things people love</p>
</li>
<li><p>must have strong characters of distinctive local materials and forms: keep things local. you don’t want every place to feel the same</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li><p>all most beautiful towns have squares. art of the square: not too big, not too small (&lt;30m): a feeling of containment, but not claustrophobia</p>

<li><p>someone is getting bullied: can choose to ignore in safety or try to protect (effect is losing a lot of money or something idk). an alternate scenario is a group of kids takes something important from someone, like hat of paperboy. at this point, paperboy should have already told you that the hat is from someone or something, hence it’s super important to him. the group of kids should take and taunt the kid with the stuff, maybe even throw to ground and stomp. you can choose to stay hidden or run and try to take the hat from the kids. maybe the option could include an effect that you will probably look money or inventory or something. an option is that if you’re friends with another character, maybe if you choose the option to protect object/other character, that character will come in and save the day, so basically you can help without losing anything</p>

</li>
<li><p>character helps you run away and hide from someone or something: they smile and tell you this is their favorite hiding spot. implies that they are often on the run and have to hide from people.</p>
</li>
<li><p>rich/pressured to be proper child — (once you get the know them more and they become relaxed-ish): event where they start walking/playing around “childishly” (e.g. not stepping on cracks, only stepping in certain places). event can go like:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>you: Oh! What’re you doing?</p>
</li>
<li><p>them: Ah, I was just avoiding stepping on the cracks on the sidewalk.</p>
</li>
<li><p>you: Sounds fun! I’ll do it too!/I’ll join you!/Heh, you’re so childish./That’s not very proper.</p>
</li>
<li><p>them: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>if answer 1: <em>looks at you kind of surprised, wild eyed. then breaks into a large smile or something</em> (Thanks for joining me!)</p>
</li>
<li><p>if answer 2: <em>looks at you kind of surprised, wild eyed. face turns red. looks down in shame for a second. looks up with a sad, smiling, embarrassed face</em>  Says that you’re right. They should act more properly. (can choose to say more like: “how embarrassing. I’ve acted so shamefully in front of you. My parents would be ashamed of me.” or something to reveal more of their background. Can also choose to allude rather than say.” [see notability for sketches of face reaction]</p>
<p>Note: be careful about speech mannerism. too exaggerated would be cringe.</p>

</li>
<li><p>gift-giving day (similar to one like christmas): great opportunity for character insight.</p>
</li>

</ul>
<blockquote><p>examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rich kid: parents are always ready to buy him anything, so they think that it is unnecessary to give him gifts on gift-giving day. thus, they don&#39;t celebrate and it is just another day to him. especially lonely for him.</li>
<li>other, poorer kids: maybe one gift that isn&#39;t expensive, but is really well-thought out. kids are very excited for the gifts. maybe one doesn&#39;t even get gifts, but their loved ones come home, so they can meet and that&#39;s the best.</li>

<p>&quot;This whole damn library and not a single book about how to fight a pelican? Shit, do I have to write that book myself?&quot; or &quot;What kind of library doesn&#39;t have any information about how to fight a pelican? Do I have to write a book myself?&quot;</p>
<p>They contemplate between acting big and taking up a lot of space, barking at the pelican,  straight up screaming, and acting like an aggressive pelican themself.</p>
<p>Depending on what they choose to do, the pelican reacts accordingly. Most of the time, the pelican is unamused. They end up as buddies or arch rivals. Eventually they make up or something lol.</p>

<h2>Writing Tips</h2>
<h3>Writing Characters People Care About</h3>
<p>Short recap:</p>
<blockquote><ol start='' >
<li>Don&#39;t just world build: what story is about (W) vs external plot events (w)</li>
<li>Themes: the idea that the storyteller wants to get across; characters have conflicts but the theme wins</li>
<li>Characters: must have arc and always be moving forward, whether up or down [good content here]</li>
<li>Show don&#39;t tell</li>
<li>Rise above: strong characters and stories have flaws, thus conflicts; just be believable, not realistic</li>
<li>Visual basics: appeal; it&#39;s about invoking a reaction from the audience; also avoid visual cliches</li>

</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol start='' >
<li>Some writers have this advice: you should have a playlist of your character’s favorite music, what they ate for breakfast that morning, their favorite color, but avoid the trap of world building so much that it&#39;s too late to tell your actual story:</li>

</ol>
<p>Focus on the uppercase W: <mark>What your story is about!</mark> What makes us understand and care about characters, things like character arcs and themes.</p>
<p>Not the lower case w: all things in world building like the plot and the external events that happen. </p>
<blockquote><p>example: Jaws</p>
<ul>
<li>W: character overcoming the fear of water</li>
<li>w:  3 dudes who hunt a shark</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>THIS is how you create characters people care about. <mark>A plot, the action set-pieces, the external events that happen in a story aren’t enough to make us care about a character. But seeing them go through something and how they act and grow, that does.</mark> This relates to themes.</p>
<ol start='2' >
<li>Themes:</li>

</ol>
<p>Not a word like revenge, rather a statement. Revenge is short-sighted and will come back to you. Theme is like the moral of a story, but not blatantly stated. <mark>It’s the idea that the storyteller wants to get across to you. Characters will come on both sides of this idea, maybe have some conflicts over this ideal and ultimately the storyteller chooses which side wins.</mark> The strongest stories use themes as a branching off point, as a spine for the rest of the story and ever idea either supports/relates to it or is trimmed off.</p>
<ol start='3' >
<li>Characters:</li>

</ol>
<p><mark>Characters need to move forward, have an arc</mark>. The way people will most potently care about your character is if they get to experience and see this character going through this arc firsthand. You can make a character tragic with a sad backstory or triumphant, and people care the most if they see them going through this firsthand. Seeing them start from one place and growing, either learning something or going through a change as a person, either postively or negatively. <mark>The more honest and self-actualized as a person, the more heartfelt a story and characters.</mark> Don’t let characters sit still. Don’t tell us the things that happened, show us.</p>
<ol start='4' >
<li>Show don’t tell:</li>

</ol>
<p>Don’t write a long biography about your character, who their parents were, what powers they used to have all those things, then expect people to read it. Like, describing a dream isn’t fun. You need to make them experience it, like making a movie and getting them to watch and experience it. </p>
<ol start='5' >
<li>Rise above:</li>

</ol>
<p>Rise above plausibility, and instead focus on what makes characters and stories so powerful in the first place. If you create strong characters, they’re going to have flaws. They’ll be prone to making mistakes, miscommunications and have conflicts over these. <mark>It doesn’t have to be realistic, just be believable.</mark></p>
<ol start='6' >
<li>Visual Basics:</li>

</ol>
<p>Especially if you’re designing and drawing characters, it’s important to <mark>make people care about them visually</mark>. You can make people take your characters at face value or you can subvert those expectations, make them not what they seem. Either way, you’re communicating something to them. Give appeal! (like baby features to make them adorable or ruggedly handsome are all appeal). It’s about <mark>invoking a reaction from your audience</mark>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Visual Cliches to avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overly dark or brooding (wears all black, really sullen and downcast all the time)</li>
<li>Rainbow color schemes (using too many of them) in a character</li>
<li>Casts of characters that include but are not limited to anime aesthetics—this is where all characters are basically, roughly the same size and shape. All looks pretty much the same except for a change in hairstyle, hair color, eye color.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Other tips to make realistic characters:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>birds of a feather flock together: characters should not be isolated from their own</p>
<blockquote><p>example: girls will flock together with girls, and asians with asians</p>
<p>Note: not sure how relevant this is with children</p>

</blockquote>
<ol start='' >
<li><strong>One Shot</strong></li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>uses the players&#39;s real name from computer</li>
<li>gives responses based on the player&#39;s name (e.g. if it&#39;s the same name as another player, if it&#39;s a swear word, etc.)</li>
<li>breaks the fourth wall; player is &quot;god&quot; of the world</li>
<li>creates a document outside of the game, on the player&#39;s computer</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Application: perhaps give different responses to the character&#39;s name. For instance, if mob leader is talking to you and you tell him your name, maybe he will know someone who has the same name.</em></p>
<ol start='2' >
<li><strong>Hollow Knight</strong></li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>when moving to corners in the game (e.g. little caves, crevices, etc), the rest of the screen darkens</p>
</li>
<li><p>awesome cursor</p>
</li>
<li><p>amazing sound design!</p>
<blockquote><p>examples: </p>
<ul>
<li>sounds when walking through grass is different from sound when walking through cut, stubby grass</li>
<li>quiet, unintelligible whispers when ancient text appears</li>
<li>characters make sounds: like a “heh?!” when you first approach</li>
<li>characters make sounds depending on distance (e.g. sounds like “!!” when close, and disappointed sounds when leaving)</li>
<li>sound fades when hit be enemy, gives sense of disorientation</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>cool map-viewing mechanic: pressing tab fades in a minimalistic map</p>
</li>
<li><p>general awesome exploration feel; exploring dead ends and loops, can be very confusing: just like exploring irl! over time, you can figure out and understand everything better, but at least in the beginning, you really feel lost in a wide world :D !! love this!</p>
</li>
<li><p>animation is so pleasant:</p>
<blockquote><p>example:</p>
<p>characters look at you when you’re nearby, as in they will turn their heads to follow your movement. they look at you when you’re talking, such as when a tall character looks down to meet your eyes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>particle effects add a lot of atmosphere; when the player jumps, there is dust particles generated that follows the path the player jumps. there is fog that adds to the general atmosphere</p>
</li>
<li><p>little animations really add life to the character and allows for anticipation from enemies: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeN7dHLipkY' title='video reference'>video</a> </p>
</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Application: everything! so many applications: cursor, dimming of screen when in corner, map mechanic, animations, particle effects, literally everything :D</em></p>
<ol start='3' >
<li><strong>Long Gone Days</strong></li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>ravens are save points</p>
</li>
<li><p>talking and smiling animations: the animations last as long as the text is being played. after, it sets back to neutral face! interesting! even better, animations change while text plays also (e.g. going from sad to determined all in one text block)</p>
</li>
<li><p>character development:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>wrong first impressions: someone comes off as cold and rude, turns out that everyone just kisses their ass. after talking to them, they realize they were wrong and they have their own way of making it up: by giving helpful advice (instead of apologizing)</li>
<li>people that are flawed: comes off as arrogant and condescending, but are happy that you have confidence </li>
<li>main character has interesting backstory: show don’t tell! players also get to experience what the character is feeling by partaking in the traumatic events (playing through them)</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>when the main character is sad/distraught, walking mechanic/pace slows</p>
</li>
<li><p>walking faster when on stairs</p>
</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Application: think of interesting save points, animation timing is interesting, good charcter development tips, and walking mechanism can add to feel of game</em></p>
<ol start='4' >
<li><strong>My Time at Portia</strong></li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>relationships: relationship networks and play dates</p>
<blockquote><p>examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>“befriending XXX also make their family like you more”</li>
<li>becoming friends with one character introduces you to other characters (applicable to mob leader)</li>
<li>only learning birthdays after befriending</li>
<li>having friends come to you instead of you always going to them or just heart events, basically different behavior</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Application: better relationship mechanics</em></p>
<ol start='5' >
<li><strong>Papers Please</strong></li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>storytelling: we aren’t told of harsh life in acommunist country. instead, we live a life that is affected by this. having to choose between pathos and ethos, we ourselves experience the hardship of others and ourselves living life in that country. nothing is directly told, and instead you experience through gameplay.
<em>Application: great example of show, don&#39;t tell</em></li>

</ul>
<ol start='6' >
<li><strong>Gleaner Heights</strong></li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>“previous job” gives different boost stats; e.g. Vet gives pet handling boost, Accountant gives profit boost, Wrestler gives melee fighting boost, etc.</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Application: I’m thinking we can have a conversation with the player somehow, and according to their answers, we can give starting character “adoration” or whatever points. or something to that extent. maybe also give the player something really valuable/useful.</em></p>
<ol start='7' >
<li><strong>Blame!</strong> (manga)</li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>the amazing thing is its strength in environmental storytelling and its lack of catering to the readers. by completely immersing the reader into the environment without the author worrying about explaining things to the reader, the world in blame! seems much more real.</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Application: beautiful example of environmental storytelling and not babying the readers/players</em></p>
<ol start='8' >
<li><strong>Celeste</strong></li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>portraits move and blink!</li>
<li>different speaking noises: changes pitch, pace, and style(?) according to how things are said (e.g. annoyed, laughing, solemn, done); font remains same though! do not use many fonts in game</li>
<li>nice to maneuver - good speed and acceleration in movement (responsive controls!)</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Application: nice typography adds character and wonderful movement</em></p>
<ol start='9' >
<li><strong>A Short Hike</strong></li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>solving one quest solves another quest</li>
<li>nice speech sounds (different variety of sounds from pops and clicks to Animal Crossing-esque speaking), nice general ambience (bird sounds)</li>
<li>fishing mechanism was very interesting (pressing button and pulling back)</li>
<li>meta humor</li>
<li>multiple paths to one area</li>
<li>to get players to &quot;discover&quot; an item, place that item multiple places throughout the area and once the player picks one of them up, the rest of the item disappears: <a href='https://youtu.be/ZW8gWgpptI8?t=1246'>video</a></li>

</ul>
<p><em>Application: interconnect quests more, inspiration for speech sounds, interesting fishing mechanism idea, good path-building for world, allowing players to &quot;discover&quot; items better</em></p>
<ol start='10' >
<li><strong>Tamen De Gushi</strong> (manhua)</li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>many displays of friendships/relationships through events, actions, and reactions</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Application: show, don&#39;t tell for friendships and relationships. Don&#39;t make the characters say friendly things to each other to show friendships. Rather only imply friendships due to how they react to one another. This manhua did it awesomely!</em></p>

<h1>General Learning Notes</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Visuals</h2>
<h3>12 Principles of Animation</h3>
<ol start='' >
<li><strong>Squash and stretch</strong>: elasticity. Degree of elasticity tells weight, energy.</li>
<li><strong>Anticipation</strong>: preparation for the main action. “Broadcasting intent”</li>
<li><strong>Staging</strong>: includes timing, pauses, focusing attention at one thing at a time, camera angles, etc. Purpose is to direct audience’s attention and make it clear what is of greatest importance in a scene: “Clarity of intent”</li>
<li><strong>Straight ahead/Pose to pose</strong>: animating as you go or drawing main poses and then drawing in between. Straight ahead is good for unpredictable things with laws of physics (e.g. fire, water drops, explosions, hair, tail). Pose to pose is better in general (keys, extremes, breakdowns).</li>
<li><strong>Follow through and overlapping action</strong>: drag, appendages move after the body has stopped. Overlapping action refers to the objects moving past the other body parts. Drag is the delay an appendage moves in relation to the main body part. When main body moves, tip of appendage should be last to catch up and move the farthest before settling.</li>
<li><strong>Slow in and slow out</strong></li>
<li><strong>Arcs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Secondary action:</strong> gestures that support the main action to add more dimension</li>
<li><strong>Timing</strong>: the personality and nature of an animation is greatly affected by the number of frames inserted between each main action. (Less drawings = fast. More drawings = slow); standard fps for movies is 24 fps. One drawing for each frame is ones. One drawing for every two frames is drawing on twos. Threes. Fours. ctc</li>
<li><strong>Exaggeration</strong>: doesn’t mean more distorted, rather more convincing! One way to judge how much to exaggerate is push exaggerations until they’re too much, then wind it back.</li>
<li><strong>Solid drawing</strong>: making forms feel like they’re in 3-dimensional space, with volume, weight, and balance. Try to draw characters roughly with 3d objects instead of squares, circles, etc. (2d). When drawing cleaner character design, try to overlap a lot. Without overlap, everything seems flat. Avoid symmetry. Instead of two straight lines, maybe one straight and one curve, or both offset curves. Avoid twinning.</li>
<li><strong>Appeal</strong>: characters should look appealing. Characters should be charismatic. Not just hero. Appeal doesn’t mean good-looking rather interesting or like-able. giving characters a dynamic design greatly boosts appeal: 1. Variety of shapes (give different characters different shapes instead of uniform) 2. proportions (exaggerate characters’ key proportions such as small for cute or hunched back for witch) 3. Keep it simple (animated characters must be drawn a billion times, so cut down on unnecessary information and design. Pick and choose key characteristics)</li>

</ol>
<h3>Pixel Art</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>dark with light on top shows depth/layers (e.g. dark and light leaves)</p>
</li>
<li><p>for atmospheric art, bring more depth through monochromatic palette</p>
</li>
<li><p>sub-pixeling animation: for subtle movement (e.g. breathing and trembling), useful to simulate shakings, rotations, wind effects, flickering lights, wobbling and jiggling, laughing, flicking, being stunned, shivering, and staggering mentions; more commonly used in idle animations</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>shifting colors basic principle</li>
<li>12 principles of animations is very important</li>
<li>try to reuse existing colors</li>
<li>swimmming/bleeding pixel animation</li>
<li>not too good for facial features</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>fix jaggies: don&#39;t surround row of pixels with bigger ones (e.g. bad: 2-1-2)</p>
</li>
<li><p>staircases: keep each step consistent</p>
</li>
<li><p>line thickness: keep consistent, usually single or 2-pixel</p>
</li>
<li><p>outlines: selective outline with sources of light in mind (study: pokemon sprites)</p>
</li>
<li><p>anti-aliasing:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>AA helps smooth edges; usually blends dark and light, but sometimes between 2 shades, too</li>
<li>to use or not to use, that is the question:</li>
<li>pros (AA): smooth curves on small sprite, necessary for large sprite, sub-pixeling animation</li>
<li>cons (AA): tedious, blurs tiny sprites,</li>
<li>pros (aliased): readable small sprites, limits colors, faster</li>
<li>cons(aliased): jagged linear, sharp, and block</li>
<li>how many blocks? ~length of line (less &gt; more); how many colors? 1-2; 3 if confident and enough colors</li>
<li>longer steps == more shades of AA</li>
<li>45° lines: convex curves [center is light, ends dark], concave curves [center is dark, ends light]</li>
<li>when fixing jaggies: fill large gaps with darker colors and smaller gaps with lighter colors</li>
<li>line weight: dark == thicker; light == thinner (e.g. thick/thin mouths and deep/shallow dimples)</li>
<li>banding == bad</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>colors: syosa puts dark colors and light colors together as much as possible; reusing same shadow colors looks more beautiful according to him</p>
</li>
<li><p>foreground is darker and background is lighter to show depth (e.g. scenery)</p>
</li>
<li><p>dither:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>pros (dithering): good for limited colors, skies, vast backgrounds.</li>
<li>cons (dithering): rough, gritty, time-consuming, unnecessary texture, not suitable for sprites, useless for high colors, hinders animation, wobbling frames</li>
<li>pros (smooth): small sprites and tile sets, readable sprites, better for animation, soft painted or cel-shaded feel</li>
<li>cons (smooth): may look flat, doesn&#39;t do graidents well</li>
<li>generally, use dithering where cross hatching would usually be done</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>parallax scrolling:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>the closer a piece of landscape, the faster it moves</p>
</li>
<li><p>3 different types:</p>
<ol start='' >
<li>following: all layers move in same direction, different speeds (e.g. rain, clouds)</li>
<li>traveling: lyers move in opposite directions, scene makes the camera turn (e.g. car driving with scenery in the background)</li>
<li>revolving: background loops, the front is frame by frame, camera revolves (e.g. camera revolving around the world where background is sky and front is all the different houses, trees, etc.)</li>

</ol>
</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>particle effects (application examples):</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>dust or sand particles from running and jumping around</li>
<li>weather elements like rain, snow, fog, lightning, etc.</li>
<li>weapons and effects when fighting</li>
<li>generally good for powers and effects (like magic)</li>

<h2>Audio/Sound</h2>
<h3>Reaper</h3>
<p>Basic Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>volume (white nob), mute (M), solo (S)</li>
<li>move audio freely by disabling snap (magnet icon above tracks)</li>
<li>fades: drag top right/left corner of audio snippet towards center to fade; right click fade to select different types of fades</li>
<li>cross fades: when overlapping audio clips, reaper creates a cross fade to make the audio flow more smoothly</li>
<li>pan: white knob next to volume; controls where audio is played (left and right ears) and double-click to center</li>
<li>normalize (right click audio clip): makes sound loudest possible without clipping</li>
<li>create a track with the applied FX (right click on audio —&gt; apply track/take FX to items as new take)</li>
<li>send (make an empty track with an FX, then drag other send boxes, black boxes next to volume, to the empty FX track’s send box): basically “sends” FX down a chain of tracks. the sends route the tracks back to the FX</li>
<li>loop: select and loop with toggle button near the bottom, looks like circle next to red button</li>

</ul>
<p>Sound effects (FX):</p>
<ul>
<li>FX power button allows original audio to play when turned off</li>
<li>click and drag FX to different tracks to copy/paste the effect; same with individual effects if there are &gt;1 effect in the FX</li>
<li>FX can be applied to specific audio clip and not just whole track</li>
<li>order of effects matters</li>
<li>frequency and equalizers (ReaEQ); changes volume of the frequencies, not changing the pitch of the frequencies</li>
<li>pitch shifting (ReaPitch)</li>
<li>compressor (Digital Versatile Compressor): essentially compresses the dynamics of an audio clip so that the louder sounds are softer and the softer sounds are louder</li>
<li>reverb (ReaVerb or ReaVerbate)</li>
<li>getting rid of background noise/hissngi (ReaFir): subtract. check the box for making noise profile and uncheck after background noise is played</li>
<li>shifting formant (ReaPitch): shifting down makes vocals sound like comes from a bigger person with a bigger throat and deeper voice. vise versa</li>

</ul>
<p>Audio knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>mono vs stereo: mono plays audio from one source (left and right ears together), stereo plays different audio into left ear and into right ear</li>
<li>all ambience should be stereo!</li>
<li>red tab: signifies audio clipping; beware! change volume to avoid clipping and check master mixer for clipping</li>
<li>envelopes: attack, decay, sustain, release</li>
<li>dynamics: things like softer footsteps and movement, louder sounds when being attacked/being more engaged</li>

</ul>
<h3>FMOD</h3>
<p>Set up:</p>
<ul>
<li>import FMOD unity package and install assets (Unity —&gt; Assets —&gt; Import Package …)</li>
<li>save FMOD project into main folder alongside Assets, Library, etc.</li>
<li>set Project Path for FMOD (Unity —&gt; FMOD —&gt; Edit Settings —&gt; Browse [next to Studio Project Path]): click on the FMOD project file ending in .fspro</li>
<li>make sure to hit build (file —&gt; build) on FMOD</li>
<li>events on Unity: find event with event browser (Unity —&gt; FMOD —&gt; Event Browser)</li>

</ul>
<p>Using FMOD audio software: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>create and name new event: 2D or 3D (2D is sound from the center and 3D depends on where something is in space and pans sound output)</p>
</li>
<li><p>drag and drop audio clip</p>
</li>
<li><p>assign event to a bank (right click —&gt; Assign to Bank)</p>
</li>
<li><p>build (file —&gt; build)</p>
</li>
<li><p>on Unity, find event (FMOD —&gt; Event Browser)</p>
</li>
<li><p>effects (click on audio clip —&gt; plus button near the bottom —&gt; Add effect)</p>
</li>
<li><p>multi instrument (drag and drop multiple audio files into one track): plays one of the multiple audio tracks when played; randomizes sound</p>
<blockquote><p>good examples: varying footstep sounds (5-10 different sounds) </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>randomize (click on volume or pitch circle things after clicking on audio clip and “add modulation” then “random.” adjust white knobs on the right): randomizes volume or pitch every time the audio is played; similar to multi instrument use</p>
</li>
<li><p>along with add modulation, test out different things you can do, including AHDSR (attack/hold/decay/sustain/release)</p>
</li>

</ul>
<p>FMOD Scripts and Coding:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Debug.Log();</code></p>
<blockquote><p>on a Unity script, use Debug.Log(); to test where actions are in a game.</p>
<blockquote><p>example: <code>Debug.Log(“Goal!”);</code> will show Goal! on Unity console when a goal is made while playing the game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>very useful for locating where sounds should be implemented</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><code>FMODUnity.RuntimeManager.PlayOneShot();</code></p>
<blockquote><p>find event in event browser. after clicking on the event, there is a copy icon in top-right corner of box that shows up. click on the icon and paste into the parentheses of the code, but include quotation marks. this just plays the sound when the line of code runs </p>
<blockquote><p>example: <code>FMODUnity.RuntimeManager.PlayOneShot(“event:/Explosion”);</code></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Script Listener: turn off “Audio Listener” component and include “Script Listener” component for good practice</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>FMOD.Studio.EventInstance stringNameEvent;</code></p>
</li>

</ul>
<blockquote><p>declare a string (ex: <code>public string stringName;</code>)
use the line of code <code>FMOD.Studio.EventInstance stringNameEvent</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><code>FMODUnity.RuntimeManager.CreateInstance();</code></p>
<blockquote><p>example code:</p>
<pre><code class='language-c#' lang='c#'>public string stringName = “event:/StringName”; // sets string to FMOD event
FMOD.Studio.EventInstance stringNameEvent; //declares an event instance

void someMethod() 
{
stringNameEvent = FMODUnity.RuntimeManager.CreateInstance(stringName); //Creates instance
stringNameEvent.start(); // STARTS event
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><code>stringNameEvent.start();</code> and <code>stringNameEvent.stop();</code></p>
</li>

</ul>
<blockquote><p>starts and stops event; can be used with empty parentheses or with added code (example below)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>FMOD.Studio.STOP_MODE.ALLOWFADEOUT</code></li>

</ul>
<blockquote><p>a way to stop an event allow a fadeout. still required to make the fadeout in FMOD beforehand (i.e. won&#39;t apple a fadeout from just the code)</p>
<blockquote><p>example code: <code>stringNameEvent.stop(FMOD.Studio.STOP_MODE.ALLOWFADEOUT);</code></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>Cubase</h3>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li>chord track: pencil in where you want chords, then click to place chords</li>
<li>chord pads: assign chords to pads</li>
<li>reverb and effects</li>
<li>VCA faders</li>

<li>folders (highlight tracks —&gt; right click —&gt; move selected tracks to new folder)</li>
<li>shift + scroll to navigate sideways</li>
<li>dynamics (looks like you’re drawing in fades)</li>

</ul>
<p>Using Cubase:</p>
<ul>
<li>don’t mix to 0db </li>
<li>create a template for better workflow</li>

</ul>
<p>Writing music tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>strong melody can be good</p>
</li>
<li><p>having a hook can be good</p>
</li>
<li><p>writing sections in this order: woodwinds, brass, percussion, keyboard, voice, strings</p>
</li>
<li><p>write each section from the highest to the lowest sounding instruments (specifically as follows):</p>
<blockquote><p>woodwinds: piccolos, flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, saxophones (saxes can go before bassoons too)</p>
<p>brass: horns, trumpets, trombones, euphonium, tuba</p>
<p>percussion: timpani, high-to-low instruments, drum kit</p>
<p>keyboard: celeste, harpsichord, piano, organ or synthesizer</p>
<p>strings: violin 1, violin 2, viola, cello, double bass/contrabass; harp (unclear where)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

</ul>
<h3>Zoom H5</h3>
<p>How to record:</p>
<ul>
<li>make sure light above L and R are on/red (notice: for even audio, control nob values)</li>
<li>adjust top knob (overall volume) so that input does not clip</li>
<li>(if necessary: format SD card, which will erase all information — do this by hitting menu button and scrolling to SD card)</li>
<li>press menu button and click on folder; choose which folder to record to.</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Writing Music</h2>
<ul>
<li>tempo:</li>

</ul>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>beats &gt; ~80bpm (average heart rate) tend to stimulate and excite, while beats &lt; ~80bpm have calming effect</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>ideas:</li>

</ul>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>sad person with happy exterior: happy vibes written in sad key</li>
<li>getting lost: have melody that does not return to home base</li>

</ul>
